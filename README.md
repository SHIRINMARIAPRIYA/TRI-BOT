## Contribution:
Hardware Integration, Arduino IDE Programming, Poster Designing

## Abstract
In high-risk industrial environments, manual monitoring poses safety and efficiency challenges. This project introduces TriBot, a smart robotic vehicle equipped with voice command, Bluetooth control, and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Built on an Arduino-based framework, TriBot enhances operational safety and flexibility in restricted areas, reducing the need for direct human intervention.

## Problem Statement & Significance
Manual inspection in hazardous zones like factories, warehouses, and high-risk areas often exposes workers to danger and inefficiencies. A smart, remotely operated solution is essential for safer and more effective surveillance and monitoring.

## Proposed Solution
We present TriBot, a multifunctional robot designed for:

- Bluetooth Control ‚Äì Navigate via a smartphone app.

- Voice Command ‚Äì Hands-free control.

- Obstacle Avoidance ‚Äì Smart autonomous navigation.
